# Customer Behavior Analytics System

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer behavior patterns using BigBasket's product dataset. The primary focus is to derive insights into customer purchasing trends, product preferences, pricing impact, and discount influence on sales.

While the initial plan included churn prediction, dataset constraints limited the availability of customer-specific transactional data. As a result, the project pivots towards comprehensive product analytics and behavioral insights, helping businesses understand consumer engagement, brand loyalty, and category-level demand.

## Key Objectives

 ðŸ”¹ Product Performance Analysis â€“ Identifying high-performing products and categories based on rating, sales price, and discount trends.
 ðŸ”¹ Customer Behavior Insights â€“ Understanding how pricing, discounts, and brand influence purchase decisions.
 ðŸ”¹ Sentiment & Review Analysis â€“ Examining product ratings and descriptions to assess customer satisfaction levels.
 ðŸ”¹ Pricing & Discount Impact â€“ Analyzing how price differences and discounts affect customer preferences.
 ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering for Future Predictions â€“ Preparing the dataset for potential predictive modeling by cleaning and structuring the data.

## Technologies Used
 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) â€“ Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau ) â€“ Graphical insights into customer behavior trends.
 Machine Learning (K-Means clustering , XGBoost model) â€“ implementation of customer segmentation and predictive modeling. ( Not fully perfected )

```bash
python src/etl/preprocessing_data.py
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis:
   - Start with `data-exploration.ipynb` for initial data understanding
   - Move to `rfm-analysis.ipynb` for in-depth analysis

## Future Improvements
